## Music Show Win

A **_Music Show Win_** happens during their album promotion. The No. 1 song of the week is announced per music show and each music show has different criteria for it. Criteria is usually composed of **YouTube** streaming (FREE), **voting on apps** (FREE), buying **physical album**, and streaming on **Korean streaming platforms** (biggest criteria). We only have few weeks to give Stray Kids Music Show Wins every comeback and there may not be next time for each album that's why STAYs all around the world are encouraged to help participate.

> FREE as long as you have access to internet.

Detailed information about all Korean music shows criteria and schedules are in [Stray Kids Comeback Guide](https://straykidscomebackguide.com/#musicshows "SKZ Comeback Guide: Music Shows")

## Billboard

**_Billboard_** tabulates different weekly music charts to see popular music base on album/songs sales and streams from United States and different parts of the world. It is a very popular music chart and Stray Kids charting on it may give them more opportunities.

Here's a [full guide to _Billboard _](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/billboardskz/issues/oddinary-full-billboard-guide-1042112 "Full Guide to Billboard")by Billboard SKZ (posted during ODDINARY era).

# Guide for Sales and Apps

## Korean Digital Sales

Korean digital sale is a BIG part of **_Music Show Win_**. It's also a big factor in **_Award Ceremonies_** (ceremonies to award music, performances, artist of the year and more). To get a big digital sale point, STAYs are encourage to stream the title track in a playlist and/or download the title track. Downloads count as multiple streams. Here are the following Korean music streaming platforms where STAYs can participate:

**Mel0n**

* Needs verified account and streaming pass to stream.
* You may buy verified account and streaming pass that are available from third-party sellers or join streaming project to stream free.
* Making unverified account using KKT is possible and it's usable to mass search and like Stray Kids songs (avoid commenting in non-Korean language).
* Counted in all music shows.

**Gen1e**

* Verified and unverified account may stream.
* Needs Korean number to make new account. Accounts are available from third-party sellers.
* Needs streaming pass that is available from third-party sellers or join streaming project to stream free.

## Physical Sales

Buying physical albums may count toward 3 different charts: **Hanteo, Gaon,** and **Billboard**. _Music Show Wins_ and _Korean_ _Award Ceremonies_ uses **Hanteo / Gaon** chart for criteria.

Better watch out for {{< a "Stray Kids" "https://twitter.com/stray_kids" >}} tweets or posts from their official SNS for pre-order links. Usually, some stores have exclusive benefits when you purchase from them. Stray Kids account also announce Fan Sign or Video Call events that help boost album sales.

‚ùóPlease check the **carrd linked above** for lists of shops, which chart/s their sales count to, and their exclusive benefits.

For **Hanteo** when you receive a "Hanteo Authentication Card", authenticate your album using Whosfan app for it to count on Hanteo Chart Global Ranking (it's different from Hanteo's sales chart). Authenticating will also help you collect more Whosfan credits that is used for voting on the app for ad promotion, etc.

For the album sales it is automatically counted on **Hanteo Chart** when you successfully purchased and shipped your album, the same thing for **Billboard**. **Gaon** counts the albums shipped to stores where the albums can be bought.

Here's a video tutorial on how to authenticate your Hanteo Certified album:

## YouTube Streaming

One of the easiest and free to do is to stream the MV on YouTube. It's advisable to get YouTube Premium for less bot suspicion. You may get a 1 month Premium free trial and make sure to cancel it before the 1 month ends to avoid paying for it after the free trial ends. Streaming without premium is also okay.

There are different methods to stream an MV a lot but the most advisable is doing Manual method.

1. Log in to your YouTube account.
2. Go to the video by doing any of these:
   * Searching with the keyword for example "Ïä§Ìä∏Î†àÏù¥ ÌÇ§Ï¶à \[title track\]" or "Stray Kids \[title track\]".
   * Clicking from home page or recommended video.
   * Clicking the shared link of the video.
3. Stream the video with proper setting. Follow do's and don'ts:
   * After watching the video: like, leave a good comment about the MV (don't spam!), and share to your SNS or website.
   * Quality should be at least 480p.
   * Volume should be at least 50%.
   * Speed must be normal.
   * Don't skip time, pause, and replay.
   * Turn off autoplay.
   * If using desktop/laptop don't stream on multiple tabs or windows.
   * If streaming with more than one device, make sure that different accounts are logged in and device are in different IP address.
   * ‚ùó Avoid using split screen, streaming on background or pop-up screen even with Premium account. This will fall to low quality playback which means the views may be deleted.
4. Stream other videos (fillers) around 3-4 videos with a total of at least 10-min long before you watch the MV again. Example videos are Stray Kids MV, skz-player, skz-record, performances from different channels, etc. Make sure you don't stream the same videos every time you stream in between the MV.
5. Repeat from step 2.

You may see different tutorials on how to do manual streaming but the most important thing is to not let YouTube think you are a robot. The following are my personal tips:

* Interact with good comments every other time. Be careful of bot comments. Make sure the comment are talking about Stray Kids and not a general comment.
* Either skip or don't skip ads but if the ad is the Stray Kids MV do not skip it.
* Don't stream for too long, you may rest after few rounds and then do it again.
* Log in to different accounts.
* Change methods of going to videos (step 2).
* Change number of fillers each round.
* You may either search or click recommendations for the fillers.
* Stream non-kpop videos, if you want to watch a video of a cat or a puppy then go :D

### End note

Those are the basics of supporting Stray Kids mainly to get _Music Show Wins_ and _Billboard_ but also for a chance for them to be nominated on _Award Ceremonies_. There are more things I didn't mentioned here such as other music platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes etc) but you may see them on SKZ fanbases guides.
