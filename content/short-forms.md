CHANNEL SKZ's short form lists (both by year and by category) starts from 5-STAR era. Most short form contents can be found on [Stray Kids' TikTok account](https://www.tiktok.com/@jypestraykids). TikTok web has an option to see oldest contents first. Some short form vids may be placed on other pages. I'll add the older contents such as dance challenges, collab, miscellaneous TikToks from Stray Kids accounts on my next free time.
