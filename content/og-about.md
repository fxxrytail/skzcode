## About
Channel SKZ is a fan made master list of Stray Kids video contents such as music videos, album promotion videos, variety shows, live streams, and more. The name was inspired by the weekly program announcement they used to upload named  "[CH. SKZ](https://twitter.com/Stray_Kids/status/1142734078518558721)".

The main purpose of Channel SKZ is to make Stray Kids video contents easier to find by providing links to different platforms. Contents are organized in various ways such as:

**By Date**
* What's the latest?
* What are the contents each year?

**By Categories**
* Divided by main categories
  - **Artistry** : About their music, performances and creative process.
  - **Shows** : JYPE-produced variety contents, TV, radio, and online appearance as guests or MC.
  - **Live Streams** : Replay of Stray Kids live streams as their way to communicate with fans through different platforms.
* Categories - Each categories have its own page and description.
* Subcategory - Eras, title of TV, radio or online shows, etc.

This website contains links of contents from Stray Kids, JYP Entertainment, and other official accounts mostly from YouTube and formerly V LIVE. After V LIVE's service was terminated on the last day of 2022, Stray Kids V LIVE videos are now fan uploaded to YouTube. Other fan uploads are also available here for subbed contents, VOD of livestreams, re-upload of videos from other platforms.

This website doesn't include:
* Greetings and invitation videos unless it's from Stray Kids' channel.
* Most of CF/advertisement videos
* Payed contents from V LIVE+, Fanship, Stray Kids Japan, DVDs, etc.
* Performance fan cams. I only put full cams if there's no broadcast performance video uploaded, and only occasional solo fan cams.

Please keep in mind that it's possible to fail to include/update some links because of inactivity to fandom, no links found for a long time, and being forgetful sometimes hehehe ðŸ˜… Messy organization may also happen ðŸ˜¬


## Recommendation
Other websites I recommend for Stray Kids contents
* [StrayKSubs](https://strayksubs.com) - A lot of their subbed videos are linked here at Channel SKZ but there's more to see on their website.
* [SKZ ARCHIVE by @octostay](https://skzarchive.godaddysites.com/) - VOD of Stray Kids concerts and fan meetings are available here.

## Disclaimer
Channel SKZ is not affiliated with Stray Kids, JYPE Entertainment and other owners of the links provided here.
