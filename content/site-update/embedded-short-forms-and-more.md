It's been more than a year since I did a major website update! What's new in Channel SKZ website?

# Watch short forms directly on CH-SKZ! 😍
Short forms became a staple in Stray Kids' media life. They are uploading more dance challenges, using shorts for promotions, brand deals uploading shorts (lezz go ambassador SKZ!), and they are uploading more fun short contents that I have to include them in the masterlist. 😆  

We can now watch the short form videos by clicking the detailed thumbnail! The thumbnails have date and title on it to provide more context. The embedded videos/posts from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter/X will appear. It will lessen the directing to other apps to watch these short vids. Direct link is available on the pop-up if you want to interact with the original post. 

One unfortunate thing is @realstraykids IG reels can't be played with embed, some accounts have embed restrictions and our kids' account is one of them 😅. The embedded post will appear but will ask to watch it on Instagram. But it's not so bad, I'll only put @realstraykids' IG Reels if it's not available on other platforms. Most brand accounts don't have this restrictions and it's lovely to see our ambassador kids 😍. Most of the short forms are uploaded across the platforms but my main source is YouTube and if I didn't see the content there, I will look on the other platforms.

Thumbnails are fetched from YouTube only. SKZ OT8 pic will be a placeholder for unfetched thumbnails.

First 50 short form videos are displayed at the home page. You may see the full list by year from latest to oldest on "Short Forms" page and categorized on "Short Forms by Category" page 😊. 

# Better layout of contents
Previously, there was an awkward big space beside the thumbnail of contents when displayed on bigger screen, thumbnails are not properly sized causing an awkward overflow on the padding (it annoys me personally 😂). I fixed the sizing and positions of main contents. I also put a background image to lessen awkward blank space. Scrolling the page reminds me of "Falling Up" and makes me want to put Tower of God's Bam on it haha (to be followed or not?). 

The dark/light theme button is now visible on nav bar for smaller screens too. Previously it was in the burger menu. It's easier to switch dark and light mode now.

# Bonus: Special Thanks To
Special thanks to **THE Legendary** HP Laptop-san who has been with me for many years and the pioneer worker of Channel SKZ ever since the beginning of it. It paved the way! A very dependable and hardworking gramps who tries its best to work even though it's very old, slow and specs are outdated. I still managed to do some content and site updates with it even though it took me months to finish. 

Senior Laptop-san is on its retirement. Thank you for holding on almost 10 years with me. More than 10 years of life! You probably outlived other laptops. I salute you gramps 🫡.

I also want to thank Leeno, who helps me in continuing gramps' legacy. I finished this update with Leeno, a very dependable newbie. Let's work together for 20 years+ 🤝.

And thank **YOU** for reading this long and silly post. Thank you for visiting Channel SKZ. I hope you like it! 😊
