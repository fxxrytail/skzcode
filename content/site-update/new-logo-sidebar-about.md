## Support for Channel SKZ
Channel SKZ is FOIVE🖐🏼. It's been 5 years since this website was made from scratch hehehe. Since then, I've been putting a lot of thoughts in updating SKZ contents and this website so STAYs can use this well.

If you love the website so far, you may send some love through **Ko-fi** or **GCash**. The Ko-fi is named **peypercat** instead of **daisukijeu**. It's also me, in case you're wondering =) This is really optional if you want to support me 😊

## All ads are removed!
The advertisements throughout the website are all removed~!

At first I thought it works well and I'm gaining a little revenue from it but I got reports from STAYs that the website is showing unwanted ads that pops out. I contacted the ad support to fix the issue. The issue was fixed but the revenue stopped moving 😅 The support said certain actions should be made by the website viewers for the CPM and revenue to go up and the ad type I put in this website is weaker than other ad types (those ads that pops up to your face 😅) I don't want to put those kinds of ads coz I don't want STAYs to be annoyed by it. After weeks of letting it be, the revenue is still stuck. I just decided to completely remove it. Too bad, it's in my plan to donate part of it for Stray Kids comeback digital streaming projects. That's what "🍰💸🎁🏊💧🍈🧞🐞" meant in the previous post but I can't say it directly coz I might get in trouble for asking people to purposely view ads?? I wanted to copy the apps and websites that made us view their ads so we can vote for SKZ. I actually have other ideas for it like little SKZ themed game but in other website? It's just an idea, I don't know if I can do it. I gave up with the ads now so I hope you get to view the website even better without the ads in between =)

I didn't get any of the revenue because it needs to reach a certain amount before I could transfer it to paypal. The total revenue I got since July 15, 2023 until today is only at 12% I will not get it because I'm closing my account from the ad website.
