There are three site-updates this time.

## More Pages with Thumbnail View

Looking for Stray Kids contents to watch is more exciting with thumbnail view added in each category pages! Quick navigation to select year or sub-category is now available within the page. It used to be on sidebar for desktop and navbar menu for mobile/tablet. I don't know if anyone knew about it and used it so I put it in page so it's easier to see. A demo on how to use these is [in this page](../content-thumbnails).

## Spot Kids: White Page is Fixed

Since Twitter doesn't support Collection anymore, its embedded links stopped working including my Spot Kids: White Collections. It's not loading in the website anymore so I just updated the page with buttons linked to the Collections on Twitter. You may view it on your browser.

## ADditional thing..

There are now advertisements across the website. I only picked types of banner ads so it don't interrupt with your browsing experience. You shouldn't be directed to other url unless you clicked a banner ad! I put "Advertisement" label on the ads so you can differentiate it from contents in the website. Only Stray Kids contents and ch-skz links should open in different tab. Feel free to browse CH-SKZ as you normally do.

If you encounter problems you may contact through [daisukijeu](https://twitter.com/daisukijeu). I may not easily see message requests so you may mention me if you sent DM. Or send email at daisukijeu@gmail.com

If unwanted links opened as soon as you open the website please send the following details:
1. A screenshot of the unwanted ads;
2. The last time when you've seen these ads (date and time);
3. Device formats where the wanted ads appear (mobile/tablet/laptop/desktop);
4. Operating systems (Android/iOS/Windows/MacOS/Linux);
5. Geos (country you're located in);
6. Your browser and its version.

Thank you very much!
