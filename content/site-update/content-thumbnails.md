First of all, 0325 Happy 5th Debut Anniversary to Stray Kids~! Whooohooo! <3

Browsing contents on this site is more fun because thumbnails are now available [heart eyes]! Since most of the contents, including their livestreams are now available on YouTube, I'm finally able to add an option to view and hide thumbnails for most of Stray Kids contents. It's easier to see a preview of what the content looks like if there's a thumbnail right? Thumbnails are now available on [Home](/) page and the new [All Contents By Year](/all-contents/) page. It's only available on these pages (for now???) so that the website will not load slowly.

### How to use
[youtube video of tutorial]

You may also hide the thumbnails if you prefer list view only by clicking the **list icon**. Just click the **image icon** to view thumbnails again. You may also easily jump to months by clicking **Select Month** button.

The thumbnails visible are only from the first link if links are group together in one date and category. The thumbnails are not clickable, click the title of the content to go to the video. The thumbnails shown are from YouTube only. There is a "No Thumbnail Available" image if it's from a different website, it doesn't mean the video is unavailable (but there might be a case that it is indeed unavailable). If the YouTube video is unavailable, there is a gray image that is shown. I don't usually check if the links are still working so you may find unavailable links [one tear emoji].

I hope this will help in your browsing experience. Enjoy~!
