Hello STAYs~! I'm finally done updating my sheet and the V LIVE links are now STAYs' archived videos! It took longer for me to finish coz of holidays, other life events, duties, and dealing with errors O<<. Anyways, I hope it's all good now. If not, please tell me if there are any mistake.

# Surprise Lives
I also updated some title for more description. Like before, the titles don't mean it is the translations of the original title. A lot of it are short description I put to know what the live is all about. I also changed some dates basing on when the live started. Inaccuracy may still happen because sometimes SKZ will go live late at night and the replay was uploaded after midnight hahaha but mistake (if there's any) may only be with one day difference.

# V LIVE links of SKZ original series
Stray Kids contents were usually uploaded on both YouTube and V LIVE. Aside from YouTube links, I originally added V LIVE links of their contents such as SKZ-Talker, Kids Room Series, etc. because it used to have subtitles first before YouTube's video and it had subtitles in more languages. Now that V LIVE is gone, I only put the original YouTube links and some has the subbed video uploaded by STAY.

# Disclaimer
I only copied the links of what other STAYs had uploaded to their channels. I do not manage these channels except "CH-SKZ" on YouTube. I wouldn't know if the link becomes unavailable due to copyright or other reasons. If the link/s I put here becomes unavailable (I hope not!), you may look for it from the channels/website below.

A round of applause for the STAYs behind these channels :clap:. You Make Stray Kids' videos STAY!

* Stray Kids Vlive Archives {{< a "YouTube" "https://www.youtube.com/@StrayKidsArchives" >}}
* skz vlive archive {{< a "YouTube" "https://www.youtube.com/@skzvlivearchive" >}}
* changbinniest (subbed videos) {{< a "YouTube" "https://www.youtube.com/@changbinniest" >}}
* aekywae {{< a "archive.org" "https://archive.org/details/@aekywae" >}}



Let's hope the archived videos will live long forever T_T (unlike V LIVE -_-)

# P.S.
I found out that I forgot to put "Airplane" Video edited by Seungmin on my "V LIVE Only Contents" sheet. I only found a screen record of it uploaded to YouTube, is there anyone who knows who has a proper downloaded/uploaded video of it ;_;? DM or mention me {{< a "@daisukijeu" "https://twitter.com/daisukijeu" >}}
