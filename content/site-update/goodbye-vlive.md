# V LIVE will close down!
V LIVE, a platform that is mostly known by its livestreams that connect artists and fans, {{< a "will end its service by December 31st 2022." "https://www.vlive.tv/notice/4749" >}} This was one of Stray Kids' most used platforms and they were very active in turning on livestreams to communicate with STAYs and this was also another platform where Stray Kids contents were officially uploaded. I made sure to include V LIVE links even if contents are available on YouTube because more languages of subtitles were available on V LIVE. A lot of V LIVE links are present in this website so it's sad to hear this news. V LIVE contents of artists will only be transferred if they are in Weverse and as of this writing, Stray Kids are not in Weverse and doesn't show signs of joining or didn't say anything if they'll have the contents backed-up. Because of termination {{< a "STAYs are archiving the contents from V LIVE." "https://twitter.com/CH_SKZ_/status/1586704182572068864" >}}

For those who wants to binge watch or download the contents before termination, I decided to share a spreedsheet containing links of Stray Kids surprise V LIVEs (which was a lot ðŸ˜­), videos only uploaded on V LIVE, V LIVE album promotion live streams, comeback showcase, performances, videos from different channels that features Stray Kids, and Stray Kids original contents that only have V LIVE subs. These are only the direct public links and no paid or exclusive contents are included. {{< a "You may view the spreedsheet here."

# Changes in CHANNEL SKZ Website
I slowly started to update some things in CHANNEL SKZ that are related to V LIVE.
## 1st week of November
- "V LIVE" page is now "LIVE" since other SKZ livestreams from different platforms are also included in this page
- Updated some pages description
- Changed "V LIVE" tags to "LIVE"
- Added tag links on "ALL LIVESTREAMS" (formerly "ALL LIVES")
- "VLIVE ONLY CONTENTS" seen on home page

For now, V LIVE links will remain and after V LIVE is terminated, links will be removed or will change to STAY's upload of the content.

I will continue to work on this website even if there may be a lot of changes since I like doing this for STAYs and baby STAYs. I hope you will still find this website helpful ðŸ¤—. Your nice words and recommending my website to our co-STAYs makes me motivated to continue this ðŸ¥º. 143 STAYS! Thank you for visiting ðŸ’—
