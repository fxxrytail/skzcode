Quick navigation to select year or sub-category is now available within the page. It used to be on sidebar for desktop and navbar menu for mobile/tablet. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anyone knew about it and used it so I put it in page so it&amp;rsquo;s easier to see. A demo on how to use these is &lt;a href=&#34;../content-thumbnails&#34;&gt;in this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello STAYs~! I&amp;rsquo;m finally done updating my sheet and the V LIVE links are now STAYs&amp;rsquo; archived videos! It took longer for me to finish coz of holidays, other life events, duties, and dealing with errors üôÉ. Anyways, I hope it&amp;rsquo;s all good now. If not, please tell me if there are any mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;v-live-will-close-down&#34;&gt;V LIVE will close down!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;V LIVE, a platform that is mostly known by its livestreams that connect artists and fans, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vlive.tv/notice/4749&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;will end its service by December 31st 2022.&lt;/a&gt; &#xD;&#xA; This was one of Stray Kids&amp;rsquo; most used platforms and they were very active in turning on livestreams to communicate with STAYs and this was also another platform where Stray Kids contents were officially uploaded. I made sure to include V LIVE links even if contents are available on YouTube because more languages of subtitles were available on V LIVE. A lot of V LIVE links are present in this website so it&amp;rsquo;s sad to hear this news. V LIVE contents of artists will only be transferred if they are in Weverse and as of this writing, Stray Kids are not in Weverse and doesn&amp;rsquo;t show signs of joining or didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything if they&amp;rsquo;ll have the contents backed-up. Because of termination &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CH_SKZ_/status/1586704182572068864&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;STAYs are archiving the contents from V LIVE.&lt;/a&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All Contents on Home Page &#43; Summary Page</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/site-update/all-contents-on-home-page-summary-page/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There were STAYs that reached out to me asking how can they easily see Stray Kids contents from 2017 to 2021 because the home page only displays 2021. I was asked if I can make the same list by dates starting from 2017 so I decided to finally worked on the update ^^. The all contents by date was up since Sep. 26 and I started to work on content summary after that. I had summary each year from the previous version of my site and it took me long to finally work on bringing it back on the new version. And finally I finished the Summary page! Yay!!! I hope it will be helpful for STAYs who want to look back on what contents Stray Kids released each year and I put most of them in chronological order to make it a journey from pre-debut to now. Because Summary page is already up, I&amp;rsquo;m going to rearrange the Shows page in non-chronological order and separate the complete series and ongoing ones. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s necessary but I want to provide other options ^_^&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally! I managed to do a major update for this website!! This website used to be just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that convenient to add and edit contents because I had to manually edit from multiple pages. I wanted to make it a dynamic website so I can organize contents easier and that&amp;rsquo;s something I had experience from school but&amp;hellip; the requirements&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s why I searched for alternative and after a lot of times I searched I already found open-source solutions :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Little backstory. This website started around August 2018 when I decided that I want to make a website from scratch to practice HTML and CSS. I enjoyed watching a lot of Stray Kids contents so I decided I want to make a website about them. My inspiration was a Wanna One website that archives Wanna One contents. There was also a post by a STAY that has Stray Kids existing contents. I forgot if it was from Reddit or another website but the post said something like &amp;ldquo;It will be hard to catch up on Stray Kids future contents so here are some of it&amp;rdquo;?? I&amp;hellip; can&amp;rsquo;t remember&amp;hellip; That post was really helpful &amp;lt;3 What I can remember is the last video I watched with that post&amp;rsquo;s help is the 3NORACHA  V Live :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>
